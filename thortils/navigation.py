Navigation in ai2thor; pose transform is generic, but pose
convention follows ai2thor as below.

See project README; Poses in ai2thor:

 position (tuple): tuple (x, y, z); ai2thor uses (x, z) for robot base
 rotation (tuple): tuple (x, y, z); pitch, yaw, roll.
    Not doing quaternion because in ai2thor the mobile robot
    can only do two of the rotation axes so there's no problem using
    Euclidean.  Will use DEGREES. Will restrict the angles to be
    between 0 to 360 (same as ai2thor).

    yaw refers to rotation of the agent's body.
    pitch refers to rotation of the camera up and down.

 "Full pose" refers to (position, rotation), defined above
 "simplified pose" refers to (x, z, pitch, yaw)

 "action" refers to navigation action of the form (action_name, (forward, h_angle, v_angle))
 "action_delta" or "delta" refers to (forward, h_angle, v_angle)
